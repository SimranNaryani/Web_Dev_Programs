        A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer. 
       In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.
       A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.
        <br />
        <br />
        JavaScript statements are composed of: Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.
        <br />
        This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="demo":
        <br />
        <b> document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly."; </b>
        <br />
        <br />
         Most JavaScript programs contain many JavaScript statements. 
         The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.
         <br />
         <br />
         Semicolons separate JavaScript statements. Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement.
         When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed:
         <br />
         <b> a = 5; b = 6; c = a + b; </b>
         <br />
         <br />
